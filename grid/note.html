<!-- 
 For a simple website → Always use both, separate Flex & Grid.
For moderate/complex websites → Nested layouts (Flex inside Grid or Grid inside Flex) are practical.

note give fixed size to any
only if must need/compulsory

website structured in Grid and Flex and combined
Grid: for complex
-grid-template-areas, grid-template-columns, grid-area 
- collage of photo
- whole page etc.

Flex: for simple
flex, wrap, gap, justify-content, justify-self, align-items, align-self
-navbar, footr etc.

min/max width = %
min/max height = vh
clamp(gap)
color in #abcd form like for white #ffff
backdrop-filter for blur(for full transparency little opaque)

padding/margin/border = rem
(border= px?)

Design must start mobile viewport
mobile: normal css(1 column)
then
tablet & desktop: media

tricks:
show/hide different elements no of element,
 a/c to size: 
 like mobile less elements
 like table more elements
 and desktop most.

using diffent feature that minimize the complexity,
-hamburger for complex navbar(with many menu lists)

Keeping much less contents in header, section, navbar and footer as a beginner & also 
having idea of keeping all content in center of website or automatic space without any of the fixed,
leaving left and right space, making alot safer.
ex:
While aligning center
width: 50;
margin: auto;

In flex;
justify-content: center; -->
